This tool is to do something similar to what [`create_synonym_db()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-create-synonym-db.html) does in MySQL, but outside of the database.

Limitations: TiDB doesn't support updatable views ([ref](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/mysql-compatibility#views)).
